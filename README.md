# CS663 Assignments
As part of our [Digital Image Processing](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ajitvr/CS663_Fall2020/) course at IIT Bombay, we implemented various image processing algorithms across 5 assignments. Some of them are given below:

* a1 - Transformations, Histogram Matching & Equalization\
* a2 - Filtering (Bilateral, Patch-based filter)\
* a3 - Segmentation\
* a4 - Singular Value Decomposition, PCA, Face Recognition System\
* a5 - 2D Fourier Transforms, Image Restoration\

The problem statement, code and the report can be found in each assignment
